# User Role Authorization

## Context and Problem Statement

{we needed to decide on hpw we would implement authorization in our program between different users}


## Decision Drivers

* {Needed to allow for multiple different types of users}
* {Needed to make sure that functionality could be seperated }


## Considered Options

* {token based}
* {role based}

## Decision Outcome
-CHOSE ROLE BASED AUTH
Chosen option: "{Role based}", because {wihtin in our scope is only two roles but eveentually many more would be added and with an nvc architecure and the roles in our db adding more should not be a problem}.
