# {Tech Stack}

## Context and Problem Statement

{we needed to decide what technologies we would use to implement our proof of concept}


## Decision Drivers

* {Scalability it needed to allow for lots of new features and users}
* {Maintainability this company was long standard and would need a future proof system}
* {Speed of development as we only had a limited time and resources to produce the scope}

## Considered Options

* {React + Node}
* {flask}
* {laravel}
* {express}

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "{express}", because {it allows for lots of packages and features all interlinked easy and is quick to produce as well as being easy to maintain and test}.

### Consequences

* Good, because {QUick and easy to rpoduce express apps}
* Bad, because {not as rigourous validation control and security of code}


### Confirmation

{This will be confirmed with our c4 models showing how we designed around express and then in our implementaiton express will obviouosly be used}
