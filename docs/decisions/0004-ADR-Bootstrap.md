# Frontend framework choice

## Context and Problem Statement

we had to make a descions of what frameowkrs and or css libraries we would use to design our frontend for the proof of concept

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
## Decision Drivers

* {Speed of Development due to time constraints}
* {Ease of setup}
* {Quality of widgets}
* {Effect on performance}
* {Usability}

## Considered Options

* {Tailwind}
* {Bulma}
* {Bootstrap}


## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "{Bootstrap}", because {It is a fairly lightweight, easy to setup and familiar looking css framework that allows for quck production of applications especially like in our case with a limited scope for a proof of concept}.

### Consequences

* Good, because {It is a familiar style that users will have experienced before and is easy to follow}
* Good, because {It is quick to setup and produce work meaning shorter developemnt times}
* Bad, because {It is fairly basic looking compared to other frameworks and app styles out there}
* Bad, because {It is less lgihtweight than other options so can begin to hinder performance if too many widgets used}
