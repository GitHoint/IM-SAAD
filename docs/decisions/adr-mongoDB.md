<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
## Decision Drivers

* Information contained within the database will be sensitive

* the database will need to update regularly with stock information like which books are borrowed and who by


## Considered Options

* Mongo DB
* JSON file
* SQLite

Mongo DB was chosen as it is a very versatile and allows for greater security functionality 

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
### Consequences
